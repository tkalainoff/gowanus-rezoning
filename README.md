# Rezoning: At What Cost?
Rezoning: At What Cost? is a data physicalization that invites users to explore the extruded urban landscape and learn more about the data embedded within it. A map of Gowanus (40”Hx20”W) will protrude vertically (at 90 degrees) from a table, each side of the protrusion will be a 3D map made of acrylic. One side with extrusions depicting the Gowanus of the past and the other side of extrusions depicting the Gowanus of the future. Each extruded residential building will be a combination of clear and colored acrylic – clear depicting the percentage of market rate housing, one color depicting the percentage of affordable housing. Another color will be used for commercial/non-housing spaces. Users will be able to take floors off of residential buildings from the past and future vertical map to learn more about the granular housing data etched onto each building floor. The tabletop itself (30”Hx40”Wx20”D) has the potential to act as a “sandbox” for users to compare and contrast different pieces from the vertical map or it could showcase current site conditions.

## Background
Gowanus, Brooklyn has undergone massive changes due to the neighborhood rezoning that was approved in November 2021. Over those two years, many buildings have come down and many pits have been dug for the impending new buildings - the neighborhood is unrecognizable. The future landscape of Gowanus is just one example of the aftermath more neighborhoods in Brooklyn are currently facing or are likely to be facing soon. Rezoning: At What Cost? presents 3D snapshots of the neighborhood’s urban landscape - past and future and invites users to interact with it to gain a deeper understanding of the data it represents.

Public policy is often hard to decipher and sometimes hidden from the people that it impacts the most. Rezoning: At What Cost? embeds previously indigestible data into physical form which also provides necessary spatial context to truly understand the data’s implications. Users will be able to explore and learn about the data themselves and come to their own understanding about what it all means. By inviting users to engage with a physicalization of the data, Rezoning: At What Cost? begins to rebuild a connection between people and policy.

Information is power. By growing the access to information and increasing people’s understanding of information, people can be empowered to be more informed and active citizens, to have a say in what happens to the spaces that are important to them or the places they call home. As we witness this aftermath emerge in real time, we can ask ourselves: How can we become more involved when policies undergo change? How can we contribute to policy so that it reflects the values and the people of a community? How can we reconnect policy with the people it affects the most?
